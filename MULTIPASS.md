# Multipass

Multipass is the secure, censorship-proof, immutable, self-own, community-hosted "wallet" of self-made IDs such as :
- One Nation Passport
- Passroad (~ driver's license)
- Infinite possibilities...

Every ID document is testified by other beings from [One Nation](https://github.com/onenationxyz/onenation) and stored irrevocably inside the Crystal.

### Self-sovereign IDs

> "Your papers please?"  
> "Off course! Here is my One Nation Passport ;-)"

Living on the Earth is quite challenging nowadays for those who feel the call of freedom. Everything is more and more under control of old-school authorities. We have given them the power to decide how we should live our life, how we relate and exchange with others. Now we are even told how we should breathe and take car of our own health.

Following your heart will certainly make you break some human laws. Thus you may have to deal with policemen and other agents of governments.

At that moment they will ask for your ID. If you don't provide any, they will have to bring you in their custody in order to check that you're not one of the researched person in their files.

Let's imagine that instead, you will be able to display your One Nation Passport. Maybe the firsts 10, 100, 1000 times they will enjoy the joke. But let's imagine 10000, 100000, 1000000 human beings starts to show off their One Nation documents: the game goes to next level. It won't be a joke anymore.
 
At some point, [One Nation](https://github.com/onenationxyz/onenation) will densify into the reality. Backed with a strong network of trust behind every being, forces of (dis)order will gradually understand than annoying someone for displaying his One Nation Passport is a bad move. They will have to survive a tsunami of love for having misbehaved.

### Digital IDs

One Nation Passport will be digital and carved into the Crystal.

For the printed version, you will have to do it yourself (or ask someone to).  
There will never be any official deliverer for printed versions.

How it works:
1. Join the Crystal
1. Connect with people you deeply know and trust
1. Create a Passport
    - Choose a name
    - Choose a picture
    - Optional: birthdate, ...
    - No sex, height, eye color or any other unrelevant informations
1. Select x witness, that can testify you are the one you pretend to be
1. Save it permanently in your Multipass. 
1. It will be stamped by the trust network and downloadable as a pdf.

Bonus: Thanks to a QR code (for the policeman's convenience) it should also be readable through a web 2.0 gateway.
