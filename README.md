# One Crystal

**Welcome into the crystal!**

The Crystal is what gives full meaning to the _"Nation"_ word of _"One Nation"_.  
This is a network of a new kind, with a fresh & juicy flavor of freedom.

### One Nation: decentralized planetary nation

One Nation is a decentralized nation, free from borders, rulers & institutions.  
It's full of people walking on their way towards emancipation from unlegitimate authorities.

For a free Nation, we need a free digital territory.  
A network with no borders, no all-mighty rule-makers, no institutions...

### One Crystal: decentralized network

The Crystal is multidimensional.  
It is both a network of devices and a network of humans inspired by the spirit of One Nation.

The Crystal serves two main purposes :
- Connect like-minded individuals in real-life (Web of Trust)
- Generate self-sovereign documents & IDs (Multipass)

### Multipass: self-sovereign IDs

Multipass is the secure, censorship-proof, immutable, self-own, community-hosted "wallet" of self-made IDs such as :
- One Nation Passport
- Passroad (~ driver's license)
- Infinite possibilities...

Every ID document is testified by other beings from [One Nation](https://github.com/onenationxyz/onenation) and stored irrevocably inside the Crystal.
