# One Crystal

The Crystal is multidimensional.  
It is both a network of devices and a network of humans inspired by the spirit of [One Nation](https://github.com/onenationxyz/onenation).

The Crystal serves two main purposes :
- Connect like-minded individuals in real-life (Web of Trust)
- Generate self-sovereign documents & IDs (Multipass)

### Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0

Everyday we are using a degraded version of the web. Pioners designed it like a decentralized network with no concentration of power. Slowly but surely, old mechanics from the material 3D world worsen the beauty of it with tools like : monopolies, control, censorship, centralisation, ...

More than ever we need to bring light into black boxes with a light crystal. We need to feel home online, welcomed as we are, protected from "kings of the Web 2.0" never-ending threats.

## Network of devices

The Crystal feels very organic in comparison with monolithic pyramidal 2.0 networks.

Here are some interesting properties of this Web 3.0 network :

### No servers

There are no servers but only "nodes". Every node (ex: your device) is responsible to :
- ask for data
- store your and others' data
- deliver data you have available when other nodes ask for it

### Uncensorable

With no central servers and with data spread all over the nodes, authorities pull their hair out when trying to counterpart the spread and persistency of informations. Killing a node does not affect network integrity at all.

### Tamper-proof

In the Crystal everything is hashed. It means that every piece of information has a unique signature. Everyone access data in the network thanks to the signature. Change a single comma in a text or a tiny pixel in a picture and the signature will be completely different.  
In other words : bad guys can't compromise data you publish.

### Privacy

Informations can be encrypted at creation through a magic data shreder.  
You're in control of what is public, what is private and what is available to the one you trust and care about.

### Persistency & Right to forget

The way data is stored on the network makes it both irrevocable & self-vanishing.
Deleting data on your node does not make it disapear from every node storing it.
Nevertheless a data no one never ask for is prone to be naturally forgotten at some point in time.

### No internet? No problem!

Icing on the cake : if somehow internet gets down globally or locally, the data can still make its way through, from peer to peers. For sure, collective mind would find alternative paths to make the data travel through spacetime.

## Network of people / Web of trust

The Crystal stimulate emergence of a web of trust.  
It allows anyone to meet like-minded people and create self-sovereign Passports backed by the [One Nation](https://github.com/onenationxyz/onenation) Earth family.

When you enter the Crystal, you will find only yourself.  
Eventually, by connecting to other people (avatars), you gain access to their relationships.  
From there, point to point, you are going to discover new people in the network.

The network starts from you and follows your relationships.  
You enjoy a unique perspective of the Crystal, custom tailored by the connections you made yourself.

**You are the center of the network!** As much as everyone else...

### Gatekeeper: Manifest One Nation

To get inside the Crystal you will have to pass through the One Nation Manifest and sign it with your heart. This way, everyone in the network is informed about the strong promise you made with yourself. You decided to do your best everyday to live in harmony with yourself, the Earth and all its inhabitants. The Manifest signature testifies that you are committed to follow your heart instead of orders from unlegitimate authorities.

[One Nation Manifest](https://onenation.xyz/en/)

The Manifest brings the trust required to feel in peace in this digital spacetime. It's our gatekeeper.

### Keep away from screens

Technology is useful to find relevant people for us amidst 7 billions beings.  
IT is perfect to connect the [One Nation](https://github.com/onenationxyz/onenation) Family spread all over the planet.  
But technology should be unsatisfying enough so that we urge to relate with real life beings instead of pixels.

So the Crystal will keep strict focus on: 
- Connect individuals that should know each other in real 3D life
- Provide strong alternatives to governments' instruments of power
- Emancipation, emancipation, emancipation

Consequently, it will stay away from being:
- Yet another secure messaging app
- Yet another social media, news sharinng platform

## Next

As soon as you have a beautiful web of trust made up of beautiful people, hosted by a resilient decentralized network ; everything is ready to build any app or service on top of it. 

It's going to be fun!
